# Dockerfile for PA1: Real-Time Process Scheduling in Rust
#
# Provides everything needed to build and run the assignment: the Rust
# toolchain, the assignment's crate dependencies (pre-fetched so `cargo
# build` doesn't need network access later), `strace` (used by
# autograder.py to verify real syscall usage), and Python for the
# autograder itself.
#
# This same image is used both by students (interactive dev shell) and by
# TAs (batch grading) -- see docker-compose.yml.
#
# File ownership on the bind-mounted /workspace is handled at run time by
# entrypoint.sh, so this works unchanged on rootful Docker (any host UID),
# rootless Docker, Podman, and Docker Desktop on Linux/macOS/Windows.
