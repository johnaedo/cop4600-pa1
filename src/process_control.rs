// Thin wrappers around the OS primitives this assignment requires you to
// use directly: fork/exec, SIGSTOP/SIGCONT, waitpid, and a monotonic
// clock. These functions perform the syscalls for you; the scheduling
// *policy* -- when to call them, and in what order -- is the part you're
// responsible for. Using these correctly still requires you to reason
// about races (e.g. a child can exit before you get around to reaping
// it, a stop signal can race with process startup) -- the wrappers don't
// hide that reasoning from you, only the raw libc calls.
